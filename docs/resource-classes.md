# Resource classes

A resource is a scarce thing a unit of work demands: API calls, executor slots, a dollar
budget, a dependency's health. Each is declared as a YAML manifest with one of five
capacity models. Source: `pkg/resource/manifest.go` (schema and validation) and
`pkg/engine/state.go` (behavior).

## Manifest

```yaml
resources:
  - id: github_api
    capacity_model: window_bucket
    capacity: 5000
    window: 1h
  - id: runner_slots
    capacity_model: lease
    capacity: 8
  - id: llm_spend_cents
    capacity_model: hard_budget
    capacity: 20000
    unknown_policy: deny
  - id: payments_api
    capacity_model: circuit
    failure_threshold: 3
    open_for: 30s
```

A file may hold one manifest, a top-level `resources:` list, or several `---` separated
documents. Unknown fields are rejected. `quelord` loads them inline (`resources:`) or
from files (`resource_files:`).

| Field | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Resource id, the key used in `Envelope.Demands`. Required. | |
| `capacity_model` | One of the five models below. Required. | |
| `capacity` | Declared capacity. Must be above 0, except `circuit`, where 0 is allowed. | |
| `window` | Duration string. Required above 0 for `gcra` and `window_bucket`. | |
| `freshness_ttl` | A reading older than this is stale. 0 means never stale. | 0 |
| `unknown_policy` | What to do when a reading is unknown or stale. | `defer_short` |
| `min_capacity` | Floor for AIMD shrinking. | 1 |
| `failure_threshold` | Consecutive failures that open a circuit. | 3 |
| `open_for` | How long an open circuit stays open before a probe. | 30s |

## Capacity models

| Model | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `lease` | Concurrent slots. A lease holds its declared quantity until settle or expiry, then releases all of it. Available is effective capacity minus in-use. |
| `hard_budget` | A spend counter that never refills. Settle refunds only `declared - consumed`. Available is effective capacity minus spent. |
| `window_bucket` | Like a budget, but spent resets to 0 each `window`. A settle refunds unused quantity only if the lease was taken in the current window. |
| `gcra` | A token bucket refilled continuously: `capacity` tokens per `window`. Unused tokens are refunded on settle, capped at capacity. |
| `circuit` | A dependency breaker. Closed admits freely. After `failure_threshold` consecutive failures (HTTP 5xx or 429 observed) it opens and refuses for `open_for`, then goes half-open and admits one probe. A successful probe closes it; a failed one reopens it. Observations while open do not close it. |

AIMD applies to `lease`, `hard_budget`, `window_bucket` and `gcra`. HTTP 429 or 503
halves the effective capacity (never below `min_capacity`); each 2xx or 3xx observation
raises it by `capacity / 20` (at least 1) up to the declared capacity. A `Retry-After` on
the observation blocks the resource until it elapses. Circuits do not use AIMD.

## Unknown is never available

A reading is usable only if `known` and not `stale`. When it is not usable, the
manifest's `unknown_policy` decides (`UnknownPolicy.Verdict`):

| Policy | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `defer_short` | `DEFER` |
| `assume_busy` | `DEFER` |
| `hold_cursor` | `ADMIT`. Fail-open; only for resources the engine tracks itself. |
| `deny` | `DENY` |

`hard_budget` with `hold_cursor` is rejected at validation (`ErrFailOpenSpend`): a spend
budget must never admit on an unknown reading. The same rule holds when the Decider is
unreachable: a hard budget is refused even for an operator directive.

## Where readings come from

A resource registered without a reader is engine-local: the engine reports its own
accounting as a known reading. A resource registered with a `resource.Reader` (a probe
of an external system, `pkg/resource/reader.go`) gets a reading stamped with age and
freshness; a probe error yields an unknown reading and `available` is forced to 0.

`quelord` registers every manifest without a reader (`Config.Build` in
`pkg/server/config.go` states no external readers are attached), so `freshness_ttl` and
`unknown_policy` matter when you embed the engine and pass readers to
`resource.Registry.Register`. For a live external reading without a daemon, use
`quelor admit` against GitHub's rate limits (`github_api`, `github_search`,
`github_graphql`, `github_code_search`), which reads `/rate_limit` per call.

## Extending

Resource classes model machine resources only. To add a resource, write a manifest. To
add a capacity model you change `pkg/engine/state.go` and `pkg/resource/manifest.go`;
